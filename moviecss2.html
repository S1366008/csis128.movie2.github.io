     <p> This 2010 Swedish movie, directed by Niels Arden Oplev, relates the story of a cold-case mystery based on the late Stieg Larssonâ€™s<br>
international bestseller trilogy novels. The story regroup all elements of a good modern Agatha Christie mystery. The murderer is among one<br>
big rich greedy Vanger family living on a remote island in Sweden. Some members are Nazis supporters and others are just mean characters.<br> 
It will take the meticulous work of an investigating journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) and a formidable expert hacker<br>
Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace), to solve this mystery. The success of this thriller resides in the main character of Lisbeth who is a total<br>
marginal but yet a extraordinary computer smart, strong minded, young woman wrapped in a pale, petite, frail, and covered tattoo body.<br> 
She is as mysterious as the story is unfolding.</p>
